        <h1>Personal Information</h1>
        <p>My name is Nguyen Minh Quan, my student information is s3927181 and s392718@rmit.edu.vn and I am currently a first-year student at RMIT University, studying Bachelor of Information Technology. I was born and raised in Ho Chi Minh City.
        My family has 4 people but now, it is only 3 since my older sister is working abroad. I am really into playing games and finding out special mechanisms to learn more about how things work in the technology industry. In my daily routine, I
        usually play games in my free time. It is a good way for me to communicate with my old friends as we are in different schools now. After a hard-working day, there is nothing better than having fun with your mates. Besides, sitting in
        front of technological gadgets all the time is not good, that is why sometimes I go to the coffee store to hang out and meet people face to face. That is extremely great and feel at ease. About my IT interest, the first game that I played
        was Eden Eternal when I was 7 years old. However, my young age can not stop me from enthusiast games. From that moment, I played a lot of different games such as MOBA, Gacha, MMO. To me, games are not only for relaxing but also for
        training our soft skills and strategies that we can apply in real-life situations. Talking about my experience in the Information Technology field, I havenâ€™t had much since I just started learning recently. Most of my knowledge is about            Python and a bit of using terminals such as Git Bash or Shell.</p>
